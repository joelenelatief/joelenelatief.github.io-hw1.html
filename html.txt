<p>My name is Joelene Latief and I am a senior at Design Tech High School. I have a passion for web and graphic design, but I am pretty new to mobile programming. Through my business Joelene Jane Cakes, I was able to blend my passion for web design and cake design and create my website, <a href="http://www.joelenejane.com/">joelenejane.com</a>. I am still quite a beginner at web/mobile development and am looking forward to learning more.</p>
