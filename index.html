<p>My name is Joelene Latief and I am a senior at Design Tech High School. I have a passion for graphic design, but I am pretty new to mobile programming. Through my business Joelene Jane Cakes, I was able to explore web design (though I used the GoDaddy web-builder to create it and didn't code it using HTML) while pursuing my hobby of cake design. My website is <a href="http://www.joelenejane.com/"target="_blank">joelenejane.com</a>. I am still quite a beginner at web/mobile development and am looking forward to learning more. My experience with HTML and CSS is also not very extensive, so I am continuing to learn as I go! It is a lot of fun :)</p>
